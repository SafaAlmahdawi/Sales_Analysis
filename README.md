# AAL Sales Data Analysis
# Overview
AAL, a well-known clothing brand in Australia, is looking to make data-driven decisions to enhance its sales strategies. The company's Head of Sales and Marketing has entrusted us with the task of analyzing the sales data for the fourth quarter. The objectives are to identify the highest and lowest revenue-generating states and develop sales programs for states with lower revenues.

1. Data Wrangling
Inspect the data for missing or incorrect entries using functions like isna() and notna().
Provide recommendations for handling missing and incorrect data (e.g., dropping null values or filling them).
Standardize or normalize the data (normalize preferred) and present the results.
Share recommendations on using the groupby() function for data chunking or merging.
2. Data Analysis
Perform descriptive statistical analysis on sales and unit columns, including mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
Determine which customer group generates the highest and lowest sales.
Identify the states with the highest and lowest sales.
Generate weekly, monthly, and quarterly reports based on the analysis.
3. Data Visualization
Build a dashboard for the Head of Sales and Marketing.
Create visualizations for:
State-wise sales analysis for different customer groups (kids, women, men, and seniors).
Group-wise sales analysis across different states.
Time-of-the-day analysis to identify peak and off-peak sales times.
Utilize suitable libraries, with a preference for Seaborn due to the statistical nature of the analysis.
4. Report Generation
